## Mindset behind

The main goal for this starter kit is to be simple.
It tries not to include any unnecessary configurations, rules or libraries.
It is ought to be strict though, so the code is concise and stable.
Rules like requiring a return type for every method might appear to be harsh,
but it's here for a reason so that typings remain reliable, code stays consistent
and implicit type inference does not lead to false assumptions and fragility.
